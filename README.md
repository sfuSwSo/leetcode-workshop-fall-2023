## ‚ùì How the workshop runs

> ü§ö **Problem Selection**

- Chose any seat you want in the Computer Lab
- The OP will randomly select five (or seven) Leetcode problems from the list and post them for everyone to see.

- Pick one problem that you'd like to begin with; you can change your selected problem at any time.

> üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **Discussion**

- Find friends seated nearby who are addressing the same problem.
- Engage in discussion to determine suitable algorithms and implementation.
- You have the flexibility to switch to a different problem and join another group discussing it anytime if you want.

> üñã **Presentation**
- Before presenting on the whiteboard, ensure you have successfully passed the Leetcode challenge by submitting your code.
- Step forward to the front of the room and present your solution on the whiteboard to share it with everyone.
- Make a PR and submit your code to the repository.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Rules
- When three out of the five selected problems have been solved and solutions have been presented among all the participants, we conclude the session and head back home.
- If we are unable to solve the problems within 2 hours, we give up and head back home.
- Participants who have taken CMPT 307 are not permitted to work on easy-level problems.

## üíæ How to write a PR

- Type the following command to branch out and push your solution:  
  ```
  git checkout -b [problem.no]-problem-name 
  git add .    
  git commit -m "Any commit message"  
  ```
  (e.g. 2022-05-24-Best-Time-to-Buy-and-Sell-Stock.py)
- Once you push your solution, return to the main branch  
    ```
    git checkout main
    ```
